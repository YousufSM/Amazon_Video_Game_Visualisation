# Amazon_Video_Game_Visualisation
Visualizing Amazon.com review data for business user - Video Games category

## Description

This Data Visualisation project was a part of a Mid-Term assignment for coursework 'SMM 635 Data Visualisation' for my course MSc in Business Analytics at Cass Business School. The project had been submitted on **November 11, 2019,** and is my first project in Python. \
\
This project aims to visualise Amazon review data for Video Game Category that has been compiled by Jianmo Ni. The data consist of amazon website reviews from 1998 - 2018. The objective is to explore and present the finding of the data in just 4 charts considering  ***business audience***. Advanced visualisation techniques have not been used for this project considering business audience and the visualisation principles are based on Cairo's visualisation wheel.

## Data

## Visualisation
Since there was a limitation of 4 charts, the focus was to present multi-dimensions of the data along with keeping the charts as simple as possible considering business users. The attention is on functionality and on aiming the familiarity of the charts for the audience. \
\
**Figure 1** explores 4 dimensions of the data i.e. Total review and market share by each Product Type and Product Brand\
\
**Figure 2** demonstrates the trends (popularity) of products (ex: GTA Vice City) as well as systems (PS2, Xbox etc.) for the initial 6 months of launch. The analysis shows that majority of products requires 6+ months to start gaining traction in the market i.e. rare cases of strong openers.\
\
**Figure 3** shows the popularity trend of products (Base) and systems (Z-Axis). The figure demonstrates the probability of gaining popularity (which is less than 1%). \
\
**Figure 4** explores the possibility of "Strong Openers" (products getting 33% of lifetime traction in first 30 days) and "Late Bloomers" (products that do not get traction in first 30 days but later on turn out to be a hit). The idea of the chart was taken from the popular data vis example @ https://www.susielu.com/data-viz/box-office
